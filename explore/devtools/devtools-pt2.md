1. The bug was that when the program takes the input from the user, it turns the numbers into string types. So when converted to strings, it simply concatenates the strings together as the sum. Therefore 1 and 2 get turned into "1" and "2" prior to adding them together, and afterward it fills result with "12".
2. I fixed it by converting the string inputs back into numbers. I did this by placing Number() around the document calls that took in the input. Now num1 and num2 should be filled with number data types, and therefore result will notice they are numbers and add them together and be filled with a number as well.
